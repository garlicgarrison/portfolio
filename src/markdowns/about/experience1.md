description: Built a full-scale chat feature using a third party service and integrated it in our existing backend system. Designed and rebuilt the messaging service with in-house  microservice solution utilizing <b>Golang, Firestore, Firebase Real-time Database, RabbitMQ, Docker, GraphQL, Kubernetes and AWS S3</b>. This feature includes sending text, images, videos, audio, all other files, reactions, threading, and in-app sharing.
