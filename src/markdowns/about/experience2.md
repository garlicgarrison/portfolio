description: Implemented the voting game microservice utilizing <b>Golang, Firestore, Firebase Real-time Database, gRPC, Docker, Kubernetes, GraphQL and AWS S3</b>. This feature includes a tinder-like voting system for songs, mutual likes (songs that you and your snapchat friends liked), and community favorites (songs that your friends liked). This microservice was then integrated in the front-end using <b>React, Redux, and the Snap Mini SDK</b>.
